# Tests

There is currently 2 automated tests available for :
- user application (index.php) : end to end, with Selenium IDE
- API (api.php) : functional with a Codeception script

## Automated tests

### End to end (user application)

The scope of the application and its features are basically covered; these tests are not yet very detailed but already allow to check the essential. It follows 3 dimensions, according to [Strategy](#Strategy):
- criteria
- depth : thus far level 1. of "Depth of checks in order..."; doesn't go into too much depth due to lack of time/knowledge of the tool and because the feat will probably change a lot in the coming time
- scope : "Map"

#### Prerequisites

- [Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/) browser extension installed
- fake data in the instance to test (to create manually) :
    - users : an admin, an actor (the most important profiles)
    - entities : dozen of events (of 2-3 categories), some venues and organizers (try to link these entities, like an Event in a Venue with some Organizers)
    - in pages :
        - home : 1st event is in a registered Venue, min. 2 events in category "FÃªtes"
        - agenda : the Saturday of the 5th week of the current months has min 2 events
- mail sending parameters are complete in `env.php` and mails can be sent (really or using a mail catcher for development like [FakeSMTP](https://nilhcem.com/FakeSMTP/))

#### The tests

Suites available by user type (screen size used) :
- public (small)
- actor (large)
- admin (large) : avoid tests editing and deleting items on prod !

Tests have some name conventions :
- "vars" : could need some adaptations in values filled by user
- "r" : data is added, edited or deleted; restoration could be needed after the test

#### Running the tests on an instance

1. in your browser, launch Selenium IDE and open project `tests/ladecadanse.side`
2. disable website CSP and to detect PHP errors ensure `ENV` equals 'dev' (when Whoops error page appears, a test is garanteed to fail)
3. select a test in a suite
4. enter the URL to test (local, prod...)
5. run all tests in suite

#### Edit
...

### Functional (API)

#### Prerequisites

The application API must be configured with its access credentials defined in `app/env.php` (`LADECADANSE_API_USER` and `LADECADANSE_API_KEY`)

#### Setup

Copy `tests/.env_model` to a new file `tests/.env` and enter the values used by your tests (URL targeted and submitted credentials)

#### The tests

- authentication
- request parameters validation
- get events, with response :
    - as JSON
    - correct structure
    - required values

#### Running the tests on an instance

`composer test:api`

## Strategy

### Criteria considered to build tests suites (their scope and depth)

- features
    - priority according to importance and frequency of use of feature
    - most frequent user actions scenarios
- variables
    - environnement (dev, prod...)
    - user logged in/out
    - screen size (desktop, mobile)

### Depth of checks in order to meet the user expectations of user actions, by order of precision and complexity to test :

1. links respond and in their content the **basic** data are displayed, according to user :
    - selection by
        - filtering
            - entity type : event, lieu...
            - entity values : region, date
            - format (html, json, rss...)
        - scope
            - detail : collection or single item
            - entity detail (values selection) : summary or detailed
    - intention : view, add/edit, delete, other (report, export...)
1. data displayed is **relevant** according to filter (events : date, category, etc.) and scope (as in the previous point)
1. users are guided in expected way by handling their **mistakes** (error handling, particularly in forms)
1. data is **modified exactly** according to user action on it
1. special and unexpected cases are handled
